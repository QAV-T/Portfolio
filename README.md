# Portfolio

With years of being a photographer, tracking light, shapes and contrast in the visual appearance of our world, I compile a concise selection of images in different genres to showcase my passion, skills and vision.

## User story

I use the navigation bar to browse the different section in the site.

I like to open each gallery to watch more photos from each genere displayed.

This will take me to be interested of knowing more about the photographer approach, where I will read it in the About section.

As a visiting user, I would like to contact the photographer for cooperation or business inquiries.

## Features
